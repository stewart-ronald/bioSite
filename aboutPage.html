        Skye Elizabeth Stewart was born in Cary, North Carolina on December 16, 2014.  She is a Brownie in her local Girl Scout’s troop, a white belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and an athlete on a competitive jump rope team. 
        When Skye grows up, she would like to teach the third grade because she loves to help other people and she believes that third graders make the best listeners. 
        She also aspires to learn the drums so she can make her own beats and start a rock band. When she isn’t kayaking, rock climbing, or snuggling with her dogs, Skye loves to watch her favorite team on the field or on the court, the Carolina Tarheels. 
        Skye is part of a very loving, kind, and helpful family consisting of her parents, stepparents, grandmother, and her baby sister, Rae.  
        In fact, Skye’s favorite place in the world is her home because she knows all her favorite people will always be there waiting for her. 
        If Skye could choose her perfect day, it would be full of boardgames, playing at the park, reading Harry Potter books, and cozying up with a big bowl of chicken alfredo, with broccoli, her favorite food. 
        Skye is an inspiration to those that have the great pleasure of being a part of her life. She is fearless when it comes to trying new things and she always puts others first. 
        Never in my life have I met another person that simply refuses to be anyone else but themselves.
